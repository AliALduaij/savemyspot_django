The purpose of this project is to provide a queuing functionality to what is essentially a restaurant list app. You have been provided with a semi-built Django project as a starter file. We will be filling in the missing information together. 

For now go ahead and set up your environment.

```
virtualenv -python==python3 savemyspot_env
```

Once you create your virtual environment, go ahead and activate it, and clone [this repo](https://github.com/nalmutairi/savemyspot_django).

Make sure you install the requirements, that include: Django, Django restframework, jwt, pillow

```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Before starting, apply the migrations by running the following commands
```
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate
```

To also have access to the admin page, create a super user for yourself and provide the necessary credentials (username and password)

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run the server to get a better idea of the data that we have and the type of data we need to acquire- mainly the queue information.

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit your localhost address at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
And browse the admin panel.

You will notice a few of my most visited Boston based restaurants are already there for you along with their menu items. Just a heads up that they arenâ€™t necessarily implementing the queuing functionality as part of their customer experience, so if you find yourself drooling over their menu items you might find yourself waiting for the buzzer.
